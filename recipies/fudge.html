            <h4>Something new to try this holiday season</h4>
            <p>
                While it would be natural for a family to make a batch of gingerbread men, or even order a cheesecake,
                in some families it's a tradition to make a batch of fudge, either for gifts or for desert. Here I'll go
                over the process for making a candy cane fudge, starting with the ingredients.
