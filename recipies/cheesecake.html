        <p>
            While many people may think that cheesecake is a bit hard to make,
            and those voices may be right, a plate full of cheesecake is just to good to pass up
            for any reason. The recipe can be split into 2 parts, those being the crust, and the filling itself. You are going to need the following.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Around 10 Graham Crackers</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons of melted butter</li>
            <li>2 pounds of cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup of sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup of sour cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of lemon juice</li>
            <li>and 3 eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Grind the crackers into a dust with a food processor or blender</li>
            <li>Mix together with the melted butter and granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Pack mixture into the pie tin you're using</li>
            <li>Pre-bake the crust in an oven for around 18 minutes, slowly going from 300 degrees F to 350 degrees F</li>
            <li>get a bowl and place the cream cheese in for mixing</li>
            <li>Mix in the cup of sugar into our cheese, followed by the sour cream, vanilla extract, lemon juice, and end by beating in the eggs <strong>one at a time</strong></li>
            <li>Add our filling into the graham cracker tin</li>
            <li>Place the cake into a water bath, by putting it in a roasting pan full of hot water, and baking both to steam the filling and prevent cracks</li>
            <li>Open your oven door for a while to let the cake cool down naturally, then cool on counter, and then move to fridge overnight</li>
        </ol>
